This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
Project Name: TESTER;

In this project, I built a website using react js. This website calculates the typing speed of a person and the quality of the paragraph he /she has written by calculating the grade.
Grade is calculated by using no. of words, sentences and the no. of characters.
There is a timer which user will start when he /she begins to write and can stop when he/she stops writing and when he/she is completed timer can be reseted.
There is a box in which user should write his/her content. As user continues to write the wpm and grade goes on changing simultanously.
Now if he/she wants to save some of the achievements or wants to save some record it can be done by using the input fields at bottom of the website where user enter name, wpm and grade and then click on add to save that record to compare with someone and can compete. 
There will be constantly showing wpm on website which changes continuosly as user writes without the reload of website which is one of benfit of using react.
 Then I used css to style my website. I used html and js to create the table that will be used to record the data that user will enter and that new entry will be displayed on website along with previous ones(if any) as soon as add button will be pressed.
